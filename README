"Odus2" is a temporary fork of:

Before deploying to City production we needed to patch ODUS so that
it doesn't throw PHP Fatal when od_serialize fails because we have
existing data that contains references (working on fixing root
cause of those as well).  Odus2 allows for two additional strategies 
for recovering from a od_serialize failure.

[1] Return NULL if a od_serialize failure happens 
    ( set odus.ini:odus.reduce_fatals=1 )  This is roughly similar
    behavior to json_encode returning FALSE on failure.
[2] Throw an OdusException 
    ( in addition to [1] also set odus.ini:odus.throw_exceptions=1 )

Note: default behavior is unchanged from Odus1 (simply shit the bed
in this case, i.e. PHP Fatal)

We are working with zChina to get these options code reviewed and
pulled back into the official build (see correspondence below), 
in the meantime just checking these changes in here and continuing 
to test.  Longer term we this really needs to get back into a 
non-game specific repo.

Hi,

Xiaolong has left Zynga. Huiqiang is maintaining this technology.

I would rather expect PHP fatal error if there is violation in ODUS. As 
it's PHP extension, you shouldn't expect PHP to recover from this kind 
of error.

I also recommend work around in PHP magic function for this reference 
problem. I mean in wakeup or sleep, you set the value of refer object.

Thanks,

Ling
